 /*Suppose you have a Piggie Bank with an initial amount of $50 and you have to addsome 
 more amount to it. Create a class AddAmount with a data member named
amount with an initial value of $50. Now make two constructors of this class as
follows:
1 - without any parameter - no amount will be added to the Piggie Bank
2 - having a parameter which is the amount that will be added to the Piggie Bank
Create an object of the  AddAmount class and display the final amount in the Piggie Bank.

3 - Repeat the addition in balance till 0 or negative value is entered*/
